# Online Portfolio Selection
Online portfolio selection is a dynamic asset allocation method based on online learning techniques.
The portfolio selection task is transformed into a sequencial decision problem. And different
approaches would be adopted to achieve the goal. In this paper, we focus on one of the ”patternmatching”
based approaches, correlation-driven nonparametric learning. We improved the exsiting
strategy and built up our own Correlation-driven Nonparametric Decay(CORN-D) model. We applied
our algorithms to both stock dataset and index dataset and conduct strategy analysis based
on MSCI index dataset. And finally we applied the strategy to ETF dataset for backtesting with
the chosen parameters and selected methods. We finally drew the conclusion that our strategy is
suitable for trading portfolios such as ETFs instead of trading single stocks and performs well under
high volatility periods. We also found out that our strategy performed extremely well when there
are no transaction costs but the performance became worse when transaction costs included.
